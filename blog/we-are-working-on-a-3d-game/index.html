	<p>    We are super excited to share the announcement that we started to work on our biggest and most ambitious project so far.    <i>"Evelyn"</i>, which is the current working title, will be easy-to-approach but hard-to-master turn-based strategy game set in a medieval world.    In this post we'd like to quickly discuss our ambitions regarding the <b>visual quality</b> of our game.</p><p>    Up until now, our game development excourses happened soley in 2D land -    mainly games created over a single weekend for the <b>Ludum Dare</b> game development competition.    Looking at our ratings so far it is clear that <b>immersiveness, mood and atmosphere</b> is the strength of our games.    Regarding the visuals however, we usually spend way too much time with drawing and fine-tuning our rudimentary 2D art    until it becomes somewhat acceptable to look at.    Although we had a lot of fun doing it, drawing our art during Ludum Dare has and will always be an energy draining process.    Since a lot of atmosphere is created with the used colors and lighting in a game it is important to eliminate all limitations in that regard.</p><p>    <a href="http://localhost:8080/mouthlessgames/img/beyond/previews/3.gif" class="fancybox" rel="gallery" title="2D scene with static lighting">        <img src="http://localhost:8080/mouthlessgames/img/beyond/3.jpg">    </a></p><p>    For our 2D game <a href="http://localhost:8080/mouthlessgames/#beyond">Beyond</a>, for instance, we drew static shadows which greatly added to the atmosphere.    But letting the shadows dynamically affect its 3D environment would rise the atmosphere to a whole new level.    We are ready to change that in our current project!    If we let computer render a 3D scene, we are much more flexible with <b>dynamic</b> lighting.    What we mean is that, not only is it automatically calculated by the computer how the artifacts in a 3D scene look like and we do not have to draw them ourselves,    but - much more important - we can let the computer easily draw the same scene under dynamically changing lighting conditions.</p><blockquote>    A 3D game really is nothing more than a program that generates 2D images at a given framerate - be it 30 or 60 times a second.</blockquote><p>    So now it becomes easy to simulate, for example, flickering shadows or a sunset where the whole ambient light of the scene fades from white    to a red-ish color.    Only thing to avoid here is to not overscope and focus too much on the visual quality of the game, because at a certain point    we are competing against AAA titles which we really don't want.</p><h3>So what's the current state of development?</h3><p>    We already have a small <i>tech demo</i> ready to go in which we can already play against an opponent controlled by a very simple AI.    Here are some screenshots that show parts of the visual evolution so far, starting from the left.</p><p>    <a href="http://localhost:8080/mouthlessgames/img/noelem233.gif" class="fancybox" rel="gallery" title="First implementation of pathfinding">        <img src="http://localhost:8080/mouthlessgames/img/test3.gif">    </a>    <a href="http://localhost:8080/mouthlessgames/img/Evelyn/wer2.gif" class="fancybox" rel="gallery" title="Here we got shadows ready in the engine">        <img src="http://localhost:8080/mouthlessgames/img/test.gif">    </a>    <a href="http://localhost:8080/mouthlessgames/img/Evelyn/daycycle.gif" class="fancybox" rel="gallery" title="This is how the game looks like in its current state">        <img src="http://localhost:8080/mouthlessgames/img/daycycle.gif">    </a></p><p>    As can be seen we have played around quite a bit with multiple light sources.    We have ambient lighting, the sun, and each unit also emits its own light to its local surroundings.    With all these bright and colorful lights the game looks quite like <i>Warcraft 3</i>.    Which may also be due to the green grass floor and trees.</p><h3>Into which direction are we heading?</h3><p>    All in all nice to look at, but in fact, we aim to set a <b>much darker tone</b> to the game than Warcraft does - not surprisingly.    We already have some kind of idea into which direction this should go, but before actually implementing it we can just speculate about that.    This means that we will play around with the overall brightness of the scene and also the colors will probably be subject to frequent change.</p><p>    After toying around with some 3D models and effects in Paint.NET we arrived at the following test images.</p><p>    <a href="http://localhost:8080/mouthlessgames/img/Evelyn/chara.jpg" class="fancybox" rel="gallery" title="Nice how the details of the 3D model do not get lost">        <img src="http://localhost:8080/mouthlessgames/img/Evelyn/thumbnails/chara.jpg">    </a>    <a href="http://localhost:8080/mouthlessgames/img/Evelyn/knight.jpg" class="fancybox" rel="gallery" title="A not so crisp looking knight">        <img src="http://localhost:8080/mouthlessgames/img/Evelyn/thumbnails/knight.jpg">    </a>    <a href="http://localhost:8080/mouthlessgames/img/Evelyn/knight1.jpg" class="fancybox" rel="gallery" title="Looks like this knight has been painted onto paper">        <img src="http://localhost:8080/mouthlessgames/img/Evelyn/thumbnails/knight1.jpg">    </a></p><p>    We really like how the combination of an <b>oil paint</b> and <b>pencil draw effect</b> makes the background appear like paper    and the 3D models like paintings.    Only the parameters of the effects have to be optimized so the visual quality does not suffer to much.    For instance, if we take a look at the knight in the middle, he does not look all that crisp on higher resolution displays.    Here, the brush size of the oil paint effect was bit too big.</p><p>    We'll continue experimenting and keep you updated.    The next post will most probably be about the <b>atmosphere</b> we want in the game.</p><p>    <i>¡Hasta la próxima!</i></p>
