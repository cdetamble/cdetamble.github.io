<p>
    Phew, now it's official, our website went live - <b><i>fresh and shiny</i></b>!

</p>
<p>
    On this blog you will be informed about our on-going projects and our thought processes.
    You'll be able to peek a bit behind the scenes and are warmly welcomed to <a href="#disqus_thread">join the discussion</a> in the comments below!
</p>
<p>
    First, let's start with what has happened until now.
    <b>MouthlessGames</b> was founded in 2018, as a successor to <a href="http://therefactory.bplaced.net">The Refactory</a> which was founded in 2016.
    But our game development journey started all the way back in August 2016, when we released our first Android app
    <a href="http://therefactory.bplaced.net/software/#83d15f35-decf-4ebd-b880-e5edad783031">Jewel Thief</a>.
    It was not like that we had no side-projects before, but this time we actually finished something and published it on the Play Store.
    The game itself is nothing special, it has no impressive graphics nor is it's game mechanic addictive whatsoever.
    But holding your own little <b>finished</b> product literally in hands is something precious and valueable.
    It is a feeling that we are pretty much addicted to since then. :)
    After that we were regular participants in the Ludum Dare game development competition.
    Our motivation to still do so is not only because making games is a ton of fun, but it is also always incredible how much one
    learns about one's weaknesses, strengths and limitations.
    All this knowledge is a good indicator when deciding what to do next, where the next game development journey shall go.

<p>
    Also an important notion manifested itself after a while.
    To the software developer, computers are nothing more than what a pen is to a writer.
    It is the <b>tool</b> that we use to create something that remains.
    Information technology in general has more to do with people really than with actual software.
    It's always about the people.
</p>

<p>
    Alright so here we are now. But to where does our journey lead us from now on?
    To 3D land definitely. We only recently discovered the 3rd dimension in our game development excourses and can tell
    that we probably will stay there a while.
