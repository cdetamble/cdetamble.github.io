    Phew, now it's official, our website went live - <i>fresh and shiny</i>!
    <br>
    <br>
    At MouthlessGames we are dedicated to create video games that tell immersing, interactive stories.
    So actually we create experiences rather than actual games.
    Although we are not exactly fans of feel-good stories, we try to leave our players with a somewhat safe feeling.
    Maybe a bit thrilled and disturbed, but safe and sound. ;-)<br>
</p>
<p>
    Let's introduce 3 of our games that you can play for free to celebrate this day!
</p>

<p class=" margin-1 border-radius">
    In <b>nO mooRe</b> you witness what is done to a little girl that dreams of becoming a great painter.
    With her ambitions she is not exactly welcomed in the present, medieval times and in the stone age.
    <br>
    <a href="{baseUrl}#no-moore">
        <button class="btn btn-3d rounded green small">Help her to fulfill her dreams!</button>
    </a>
    <br>
    <br>
</p>

<p class=" margin-1 border-radius">
    <b>Disembodied</b> explores what bad things can happen if humans begin to upload their minds to the cloud.
    Promised with a life where neither the sky nor imagination is the limit they are confronted with what happens if they fall under the control of someone else.
    <br>
    <a href="{baseUrl}#disembodied">
        <button class="btn btn-3d rounded green small">Escape this virtual nightmare!</button>
    </a>
    <br>
    <br>
</p>

<p class=" margin-1 border-radius">
    In <b>Beyond</b> you help a detective catch "the surgeon", a serial killer trying to brew a life-lengthening potion out of human nerves.
    For this purpose you and the detective perform some research in his basement.
    But while doing so, the killer is also researching.
    <br>
    <a href="{baseUrl}#beyond">
        <button class="btn btn-3d rounded green small">Who will catch the other first?</button>
    </a>
    <br>
    <br>

    Lastly we'd like to mention that we are currently putting all our heartblood into creating a medieval turn-based strategy game.
    It is our most ambitious game so far and it's still in its conceptional phase.
    In particular, we have a playable prototype ready that is currently more a tech demo than a game.
    We never did a 3D game before so we are exploring new lands here.
    Here are some animations to get an idea about how the game will look like.

    What you can expect on this blog is to being able to peek a bit behind the scenes, the design decisions and some story bits.
    In particular, expect further details on the game on this blog pretty soon.
    We are super excited about the game and are looking forward to see it grow to MouthlessGame's next released game in 2020.

    <i>¡Hasta la próxima!</i>
