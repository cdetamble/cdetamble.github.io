{date August 20, 2019}
<p>
	We started to work on our biggest and most ambitious project so far.
	Up until now, what we made where 2D games only and most of them where created over a single weekend for
	the Ludum Dare game development competition.
	This new project though has a scale of rather months than days, but we will still regulary participate
	in Ludum Dare to train our game dev skills.

	Features:
<ul>
	<li>Turn-based Strategy</li>
	<li>Modern 3D Visuals</li>
	<li>Story-driven Single-Player Campaign</li>
	<li>approx. 5 hours of play-time</li>
	<li>4 playable factions, each with their unique units</li>
	<li>Skirmish against an ai or local human opponents</li>
</ul>
