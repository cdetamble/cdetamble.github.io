    Phew, now it's official, our website went live - <i>fresh and shiny</i>!
    <br>
    <br>
    At MouthlessGames we are dedicated to create video games that tell immersing, interactive stories.
    So actually we create experiences rather than actual games.
    Although we are not exactly fans of feel-good stories, we try to leave our players with a somewhat safe feeling.
    Maybe a bit thrilled and disturbed, but safe and sound. ;-)<br>
</p>
<p>
    Let's introduce 3 of our games that you can play for free to celebrate this day!
</p>

<p class="outset margin-1 border-radius">
    In <b>nO mooRe</b> you witness what is done to a little girl that dreams of becoming a great painter.
    With her ambitions she is not exactly welcomed in the present, medieval times and in the stone age.
    <br>
    <a href="{baseUrl}#no-moore">
        <button class="btn btn-3d rounded green small">Help her to fulfill her dreams in the very end!</button>
    </a>
    <br>
    <br>
</p>

<p class="outset margin-1 border-radius">
    <b>Disembodied</b> explores what bad things can happen if humans begin to upload their minds to the cloud.
    Promised with a life where neither the sky nor imagination is the limit they are confronted with what happens if they fall under the control of someone else.
    <br>
    <a href="{baseUrl}#disembodied">
        <button class="btn btn-3d rounded green small">Help the trapped humans escape this virtual nightmare!</button>
    </a>
    <br>
    <br>
</p>

<p class="outset margin-1 border-radius">
    In <b>Beyond</b> you help a detective catch "the surgeon", a serial killer trying to brew a life-lengthening potion out of human nerves.
    For this purpose you and the detective perform some research in his basement.
    But while doing so, the killer is also researching.
    <br>
    <a href="{baseUrl}#beyond">
        <button class="btn btn-3d rounded green small">Who will catch the other first?</button>
    </a>
    <br>

    Lastly we'd like to mention that we are currently putting all our heartblood into creating a medieval turn-based strategy game.
    It is our most ambitious game so far and it's still in its conceptional phase.
    In particular, we have a playable prototype ready that is currently more a tech demo than a game.
    We never did a 3D game before so we are exploring new lands here.

<p>
    What you can expect on this blog is to being able to peek a bit behind the scenes, the decision decisions and story bits.
    So long,
