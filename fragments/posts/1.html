<p>
	We started to work on our biggest and most ambitious project so far.
	Up until now, what we made where 2D games only and most of them where created over a single weekend for
	the Ludum Dare game development competition.
	This new project though has a scale of rather months than days, but we will still regulary participate
	in Ludum Dare to train our game dev skills.

	<b>Features:</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Turn-based Strategy</li>
