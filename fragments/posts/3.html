    In the last post, we discussed a bit into which direction the visual quality of our game shall go.
    Let's this time take a look at the tone and feeling we aim to achieve in the game.
    Deciding on the tone and feel is one of the fundamental decisions the game designer has to make.
    Once decided, everything in the game is built around that decision.

    In 1848, 4 young painters (all under 25 years old) formed the so called <b>pre-raphaelite brotherhood</b>.

    In the next post we'll concentrate on the story that we want to tell in our game.
    This includes a quick overview of occurring characters, a description of the world they act in, and we try to draw a line to which extent we want <i>fantasy</i> to play a role in our game.
