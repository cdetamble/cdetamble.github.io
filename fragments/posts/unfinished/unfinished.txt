    Back in the days we could not imagine something more boring than a turn-based strategy game.
    But then came Advance Wars.
    And after the third our fourth play-through a notion manifested itself slowly.

<blockquote>Weren't turn-based games supposed to be rock-hard, non-approachable by beginners and just no fun at all?</blockquote>
<p>
    And there vanished all those prejudices.
    Advance Wars is approachable by newcomers, but with its lengthy tutorial missions <b>tries a bit too hard</b> in that regard.
    After the first 2 or 3 missions you understand that you and enemy control units in a turn-based fashion - with the implication that extrapolation and prediction of the enemy's behavior is key to success.
    Next thing to be learned is to understand which unit is good and bad against which one.
    For the game designer, that is a tricky one.
    It is a balance act between burden the player with learning complicated data sets and to relying on your very own gut feeling and common sense.
    <b>Battle Brothers</b>, for instance, does an extremely good job in that regard.
    There, understanding of how good weapons and armor are, is - by a great part - done soley by their visual representation in the game.
    That <b>reduces mental load</b> to newcomers thus making the game more approachable.
    And that is the key vision for our game.
    We want to create the most <b>approachable</b> turn-based game we can achieve, targeted at newcomers to the genre.
